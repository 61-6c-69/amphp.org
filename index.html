                    Asynchronous concurrency made simple
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Amp is a concurrency framework for PHP providing primitives to manage concurrency such as an
                    event loop, promises, and asynchronous iterators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It implements coroutines using PHP's generators to avoid callback or <code>then()</code> hells.
                    Promise consumption works without callbacks and allows ordinary <code>catch</code> clauses just
                    as synchronous code for handling errors.

            <h3>Event Loop</h3>
            <p>
                The event loop is the main task scheduler of every asynchronous application. It dispatches
                associ&shy;ated handlers once the registered events happen.

        <div>
            <h3>Promises</h3>
            <p>
                A promise is a placeholder for the result of an asynchronous operation. While synchronous
                programs block until a result is available, asynchronous programs return a placeholder which gets
                filled in with the result at a later time.

        <div>
            <h3>Coroutines</h3>
            <p>
                Coroutines are interruptible functions that can be paused and resumed. Amp uses
                <code>Generator</code>s
                to allow promise consumption without callbacks.

        <div>
            <h3>Iterators</h3>
            <p>
                Asynchronous iterators allow the consumption of collections of values, one at a time. Instead of
                resolving a promise once all results are available, iterators make it possible to consume items of a
                collection as soon as they become available.

            <h3>Streams</h3>
            <p>
                Amp provides a stream abstraction that makes working with non-blocking I/O way easier. Don't worry
                about read- and write-watchers, buffering, and backpressure.
